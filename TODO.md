# Database Schema-Code Mismatch Fixed

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Fixed database schema mismatch: Changed `escalated_by` to `reporter_id` in Escalation interface and API queries
- [x] Updated TypeScript interface: `escalated_by` → `reporter_id`, `escalated_by_user` → `reporter_user`, `assigned_to` → `assignee_id`, `ticket_number` → `ticket_id`
- [x] Updated API queries in `src/api/escalations.ts` to use correct column names and foreign key relationships
- [x] Updated component `src/components/dashboards/country-lead/EscalationsPage.tsx` to use new property names and enum values
- [x] Updated status enum: 'Open'/'Assigned'/'In Progress' → 'new'/'assigned'/'in_progress'/'escalated'/'resolved'/'closed'/'reopened'
- [x] Updated priority enum: 'Low'/'Medium'/'High'/'Critical' → 'low'/'medium'/'high'/'critical'
- [x] Updated impact enum: 'Low'/'Medium'/'High'/'Critical' → 'single_student'/'multiple_students'/'regional'/'national'/'system_wide'
- [x] Updated category enum: 'school_issue'/'ambassador_issue' → 'scholarship'/'ambassador'/'compliance'/'technical'/'partner'/'system'/'finance'

## Summary
The original error "Could not find a relationship between 'escalations' and 'escalated_by'" was caused by a mismatch between the database schema (using `reporter_id` from migration 002) and the code (using `escalated_by` from migration 006). The code has been updated to align with the actual database schema using `reporter_id` as the foreign key column.

All escalations-related TypeScript errors have been resolved and the escalations API should now work correctly with proper foreign key relationships. The remaining TypeScript errors in the codebase are unrelated to the escalations functionality and can be addressed separately.
