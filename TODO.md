# ðŸš€ Real Database Integration Progress

## âœ… Completed
- [x] Created comprehensive dashboard API functions (`src/api/dashboard.ts`)
- [x] Created data hooks with loading/error states (`src/hooks/useDashboardData.ts`)
- [x] Fixed TypeScript errors in API functions

## ðŸ”„ In Progress
- [ ] Update AmbassadorDashboard.tsx to use real data hooks
- [ ] Update CountryLeadDashboard.tsx to use real data hooks
- [ ] Update ManagementDashboard.tsx to use real data hooks
- [ ] Test all dashboard components with real data
- [ ] Add proper error handling and loading states

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
1. **Update AmbassadorDashboard.tsx** - Replace mock data with `useAmbassadorKPIs`, `useAmbassadorTasks`, `useAmbassadorSchools`
2. **Update CountryLeadDashboard.tsx** - Replace mock data with `useCountryLeadKPIs`, `useCountryAmbassadors`
3. **Update ManagementDashboard.tsx** - Replace mock data with `useManagementKPIs`, `useAllSchools`
4. **Test all components** - Verify data loads correctly and error handling works
5. **Add chart data hooks** - Create hooks for lead generation trends, country distribution, etc.

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics
- [ ] Zero mock data in all dashboard components
- [ ] Real-time data updates from database
- [ ] Proper loading states and error handling
- [ ] Type-safe data structures throughout
- [ ] Efficient database queries with proper indexing

## ðŸ“Š Components to Update

### Ambassador Dashboard
- [ ] KPI cards (leads, tasks, schools, impact score)
- [ ] Task list with real priorities and progress
- [ ] School list with actual visit data
- [ ] Achievement badges based on real performance
- [ ] Activity feed from real user actions

### Country Lead Dashboard
- [ ] Team KPI metrics from real ambassador data
- [ ] Ambassador performance table with real scores
- [ ] School pipeline stages from actual school statuses
- [ ] Impact metrics charts from real visit data
- [ ] Recent activity feed from real system events

### Management Dashboard
- [ ] System-wide KPI metrics from aggregated data
- [ ] Lead generation trends chart from visit history
- [ ] Country distribution chart from school locations
- [ ] Ambassador performance leaderboard from real scores
- [ ] Master school sheet with real school data
- [ ] Alerts and activity feed from real system events

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Queries Needed:
- Ambassador KPIs: visits, tasks, schools, user performance
- Country Lead Data: team members, school pipeline, events
- Management Analytics: aggregated visits, partnerships, user stats
- Chart Data: time-series visits, geographic distribution, performance rankings

### Error Handling:
- Network connectivity issues
- Database connection problems
- Invalid user permissions
- Missing or corrupted data
- Rate limiting from Supabase

### Performance Optimizations:
- Proper query indexing
- Data caching strategies
- Pagination for large datasets
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates
- Query optimization and aggregation

## ðŸš¨ Current Issues
- TypeScript errors in some Supabase queries need resolution
- Some complex joins may need optimization
- Error handling needs comprehensive testing
- Loading states need to be implemented in all components

## ðŸ“ˆ Testing Checklist
- [ ] All dashboard components load without errors
- [ ] Data displays correctly in all widgets
- [ ] Loading states work properly
- [ ] Error states display appropriate messages
- [ ] Real-time updates work (if implemented)
- [ ] Performance is acceptable with real data
- [ ] All TypeScript types are properly defined
