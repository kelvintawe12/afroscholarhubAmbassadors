# Authentication Protection Implementation

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. Created ProtectedRoute Component
- **File**: `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Checks authentication status before rendering protected content
  - Shows loading spinner while authentication is being verified
  - Redirects unauthenticated users to login page
  - Supports role-based access control
  - Redirects users to appropriate dashboard based on their role if they don't have required permissions

### 2. Updated App.tsx with Authentication Guards
- **File**: `src/App.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Imported ProtectedRoute component
  - Wrapped all dashboard routes with ProtectedRoute
  - Applied role-based protection for:
    - Management routes (requiredRole="management")
    - Country Lead routes (requiredRole="country_lead")
    - Ambassador routes (requiredRole="ambassador")
    - Support routes (requiredRole="support")

### 3. Optimized AuthContext for Faster Loading
- **File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- **Performance Improvements**:
  - Prioritize user metadata over database queries for faster initial load
  - Only query database when role is not available in metadata
  - Move `ensureUserInDatabase` call to asynchronous background operation
  - Prevent blocking UI during database operations on page refresh

## Key Benefits

1. **Prevents Unauthorized Access**: Users cannot access dashboard pages without being authenticated
2. **Loading State Management**: Pages wait for authentication to complete before rendering
3. **Role-Based Security**: Users are restricted to routes appropriate for their role
4. **Automatic Redirects**: Unauthenticated users are redirected to login, users with wrong roles are redirected to their appropriate dashboard

## Technical Details

- Uses `useAuth` hook to check authentication state
- Implements loading states to prevent premature API calls
- Preserves intended destination with `useLocation` state for post-login redirects
- Maintains existing lazy loading and error boundary patterns

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test accessing dashboard URLs directly without authentication
2. Verify role-based access restrictions
3. Confirm loading states work properly during authentication checks
4. Test navigation after login redirects to intended destination
