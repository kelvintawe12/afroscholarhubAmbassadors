# TypeScript Errors Fixed in Dashboard API

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Fixed type casting for `task.schools` in `getAmbassadorTasks` - changed from single object to array access
- [x] Fixed type casting for `school.countries` in `getCountryDistribution` - changed from single object to array access
- [x] Verified all TypeScript errors in `src/api/dashboard-fixed.ts` are resolved
- [x] Added missing `leadsGenerated` property to `getCountryLeadKPIs` return object

## Summary
The TypeScript errors were caused by incorrect type assumptions about Supabase join results. The `!inner` joins return arrays even for single relationships, so we needed to access the first element of the array (`[0]`) rather than treating them as single objects.

All dashboard API functions now have proper type safety and should compile without errors.
